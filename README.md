# Clubhouse Webhook Auth

Package that implements verification logic for webhooks generated by clubhouse with a secret. The [documentation] for clubhouse webhooks say:


> If you provide a secret when you create the Outgoing Webhook, it will include an HTTP header named Clubhouse-Signature. The value of this header is a cryptographic hash encoded in hexadecimal.
  
>The signature is computed by the HMAC-SHA-256 algorithm. The ‘message’ is the HTTP request body encoded in UTF-8. The ‘secret’ is the secret string you provided, also encoded in UTF-8. 

Included is a concrete implementation of an [echo middleware].
